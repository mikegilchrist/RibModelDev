parameterObject.R
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Implement writeCSV for the RFP and FONSE models.

*Function "submatrices" needs some commenting explaining what is going on.

*Function "splitMatrix" needs some commenting explaining what is going on.

*"initializeCovarianceMatricies" need changes once covariance work is complete.

*Implement writeParameterObject for the FONSE model.

*Implement "loadFONSEParameter."

*Change the implementation of the loadParameterObject functions to where multiple 
objects can be read in and concatinated.

*Should add more error checking be done in "initializeParameterObject." Currently some 
checks are made, but should the error checking be fool proof to prevent R crashes.

*Add mutation prior to writeParameterObject for ROC.




mcmcObject.R
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Should we provide a default arguemtn for number of samples?

*Make sure the default values in R match the default values in C++. 
Not a necessary check, but would be nice for consistancy.

*We have est.expression as an argument to our initializeMCMCObject function, while
everywhere, such as other function calls and print statements in the code, we 
call this synthesisRate. Should be changed for consistancy?

*Details should be looked at to make sure information given is accurate. 

*Error checking should be performed at the beginning of the function to make sure no invalid 
values have been entered in.

*What is the purpose of having the runMCMC call wrapped?

*Error check values in runMCMC.



MCMCAlgorithm.cpp
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*We had previously decided calling constructors from other constructors was causing
odd behavior (at least the way we had it done). We have our zero argument
constructor in MCMC do this and should be changed. 


Other things
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Pure virtual functions shared between 2 or more models should have an implementation that
is overwritten by other non-similar models.

*Codon Table

*Test all modes (allUnique, selectionShared, mutationShared, custom).

*Change trace to one object, get rid of heirarchy.

*Unit testing

*remove warnings 

*implement additional models (NSE, PANSE)

*acf graphs for hyper parameters

*Fix restart files for FONSE model.

*Test that (see Selac code) needs to get path for file names.



BUGS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Group list is broken in working code

*R crashes when getGene is used on an empty gene.

*OpenMP pragma accept/reject phi does not work in R: R crash. Problem reducing loops with
arrays.

*R CMD check fails: namespace. 

*Change output to have R output. Need some generic function to wrap R printing.

*S epsilon doesn't converge to correct value.

*deletes on dynamic array(s) may not actually be called.

*simulatedAllUniqueR.fasta last gene codon counts = 0
